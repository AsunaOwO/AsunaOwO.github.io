👑 Welcome to the Realm of Chaos
by AsunaOwO aka The AllmightyOne
Hey there, curious traveler!
This is a tiny chaotic project made by yours truly AsunaOwO, the master of "I'll fix it later" and boss of half-working code 👑

🔍 What is this?
So... what are you looking at here?

💻 Some code? Yep.

🧠 Any structure? Hahaha, no.

🧩 Languages? It’s a spicy mix of:

English

German

Possibly Hungarian 🇭🇺

Maybe some Japanese 🇯🇵 (if i feel fancy)

So yeah... good luck reading it. Bring snacks. And a translator. And maybe a therapist.

🧠 AI helped (a lot)
Fun fact: I didn’t do this alone.
I got some "slightly more intelligent" backup from the AI gang:

🧠 ChatGPT (yep, that’s me writing this line right now 👋)

🤖 DeepSeek, Blackbox, and a few others who hopefully don’t become self-aware

If it looks too smart to be mine, it probably isn’t. Thanks, robot friends 💕

🖼️ About the Images
The images are NOT mine.
If you’re the amazing human who made one of them and you’re like “Yo, that’s my art!”
please DM me on Discord: asuna_9777 🙏
I’ll happily add your name here in this sacred README scroll of credits ✨

⚠️ Warning
This project may or may not include:

🤯 Unreadable code

💥 Chaos

📝 Very questionable comments

💡 Accidental genius (probably not tho so don’t count on it)


💌 Final Words
Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore, laugh, cry, or question my life choices through the code.
And hey, if you somehow find it useful... even better 😎

Stay awesome,
– Asuna (the AllmightyOne) 🌸🦊
